        Powerlifting coaching isn’t just about digesting the right number and
        kind of exercise science studies, nor is it about following your
        experience and heart all the time, either. Good programming hits the
        middle point of evidence-based practice, coach experience, and athlete
        feedback and influence. We blend best practices from the latest research
        with sensible middle-of-the-road training that challenges athletes to be
        better than they used to be. We continually use the athlete’s real-world
        experience to modify training because we believe we’re better as a team
        and no one knows you better than you know yourself. We believe in
        optimizing motivation through the framework of Self-Determination
        Theory, maximizing the athlete’s skill and strength competence, their
        autonomy over their training, and their network of support--their
        relatedness. But it’s not enough just to be motivated...burnout can
        strike us all and stands as one of the major reasons athletes stop
        pursuing sport. That’s why we balance training approaches over time by
        varying total training stress levels and structure, talking to the
        athlete, and making sure we’re paying attention to the major warning
        signs of burnout. We don’t marry ourselves to any training strategy,
        lifting technique, nutritional strategy, or programming theory because
        doing so limits us and clouds our judgment. By viewing training styles
        as options over dogma, we open ourselves to finding the best solutions
        for athletes on a case-by-case basis. There’s a sweet spot in rates of
        progress over time that pushes athletes to be better without simply
        doing more work for nothing. We strive to make sure we’re on the right
        side of dose response for training: we get out exactly what we put in.
        Training is continually evolving. We try new approaches for athletes
        built from observations made about you that are sensitive to timelines,
        schedule, buy-in, importance of the next competition, the athlete’s age
        and experience level, and dozens of other small factors that keep us
        working hard for you.
